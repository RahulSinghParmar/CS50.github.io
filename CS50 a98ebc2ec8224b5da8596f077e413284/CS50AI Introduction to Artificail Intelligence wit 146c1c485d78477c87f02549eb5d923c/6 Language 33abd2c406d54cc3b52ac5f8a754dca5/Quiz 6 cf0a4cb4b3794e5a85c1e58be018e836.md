## **When to Do It**

**IMPORTANT** note regarding your gradebook at **[cs50.me/cs50ai](https://cs50.me/cs50ai)**! Soon after the start of each calendar year (we estimate during the week of 10 January 2022), we typically refresh all of our gradebooks. *All of your work from 2021 will be saved and will carry forward*, but your gradebook may appear temporarily empty or unavailable until you have submitted work in 2022 that has been graded and returned to you by CS50 Bot. So don’t be alarmed!

If you finish CS50AI during the final days of December 2021, it is very important that you claim your free CS50 Certificate before this gradebook reset takes place, so don’t delay! (Verified certificates are unaffected by this.)
