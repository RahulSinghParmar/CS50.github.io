# Project 2: Movie Browser

## **Objectives**

- Become more comfortable with JS and React Native.
- Develop workflow for developing mobile apps.
- Use live APIs for fetching data.
- Use external libraries for additional functionality.
- Create a multi-page application.

## **Getting Started**

Download the distro code for your first game from [https://cdn.cs50.net/mobile/2019/x/projects/2/project2.zip](https://cdn.cs50.net/mobile/2019/x/projects/2/project2.zip) and unzip `project2.zip`, which should yield a directory called `project2`.

Then, in a terminal window (located in `/Applications/Utilities` on Mac or by typing `cmd` in the Windows task bar), move to the directory where you extracted `project2` (recall that the `cd` command can change your current directory), and run

`cd project2`

To get started, follow the directions in your project README.

## **FAQs**

- Do I need to use the API?
    - Yes. The goal of this assignment is to learn how to use live APIs for fetching data. The mock data in the repo was only for testing if you wanted to start the project before the lecture on data.
- What is the challenge for this project?
    - The challenge for this project is to add a settings screen (accessed via a tab navigator) that allows you to configure your results from the API.
- Is there extra credit for completing the challenge?
    - Nope, the challenge is just a fun feature that I recommend adding if you finish early!
- Do we need to test on both iOS and Android?
    - Nope, as long as it works on at least one of the platforms, you’re all set. We’ll assume iOS unless specified otherwise.
