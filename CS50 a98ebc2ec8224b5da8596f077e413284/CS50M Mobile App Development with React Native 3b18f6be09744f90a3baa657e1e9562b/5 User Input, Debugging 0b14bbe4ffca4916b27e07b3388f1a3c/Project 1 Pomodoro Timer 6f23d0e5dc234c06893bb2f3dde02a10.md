# Project 1: Pomodoro Timer

## **Objectives**

- Become more comfortable with JS and React Native.
- Develop workflow for developing mobile apps.
- Gain experience reading and adding to source code.
- Create your first app!

## **Getting Started**

Download the distro code for your first game from [https://cdn.cs50.net/mobile/2019/x/projects/1/project1.zip](https://cdn.cs50.net/mobile/2019/x/projects/1/project1.zip) and unzip `project1.zip`, which should yield a directory called `project1`.

Then, in a terminal window (located in `/Applications/Utilities` on Mac or by typing `cmd` in the Windows task bar), move to the directory where you extracted `project1` (recall that the `cd` command can change your current directory), and run

```jsx
cd project1
```

To get started, follow the directions in your project README.

## **FAQs**

- Is there extra credit for completing the challenge?
    - Nope, the challenge is just a fun feature that I recommend adding if you finish early!
- Do we need to test on both iOS and Android?
    - Nope, as long as it works on at least one of the platforms, you’re all set. We’ll assume iOS unless specified otherwise.
