# Problem Set 4

## **What to Do**

Did you start CS50x in 2021 or prior? Be sure to **[follow these instructions](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/new/#did-you-start-cs50x-in-2021-or-earlier)** if you haven’t already!

1. Log into [code.cs50.io](https://code.cs50.io/) using your GitHub account
2. Run `update50` in your codespace’s terminal window to ensure your codespace is up-to-date and, when prompted, click **Rebuild now**
3. Submit one of:
    - [this version of Filter](../ProblemSets%204c4bcc2cf3cd425382614733495f6ba8/Filter%20less%2023fa73e41fb94db3993e61205f50a5df.md) if feeling less comfortable
    - [this version of Filter](../ProblemSets%204c4bcc2cf3cd425382614733495f6ba8/Filter%20more%20e7dfe32659ba4b28afc202ab16874b4d.md) if feeling more comfortable
4. Submit [Recover](../ProblemSets%204c4bcc2cf3cd425382614733495f6ba8/Recover%20979baed0a35e476bb344ef94c5850d2e.md)

## **Advice**

- Try out any of David’s programs from [Week 4](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/weeks/4/).
- If you see any errors when compiling your code with `make`, focus first on fixing the very first error you see, scrolling up as needed. If unsure what it means, try asking `help50` for help. For instance, if trying to compile `hello`, and
    
    ```
    make filter
    ```
    
    is yielding errors, try running
    
    ```
    help50 make filter
    ```
    
    instead!
