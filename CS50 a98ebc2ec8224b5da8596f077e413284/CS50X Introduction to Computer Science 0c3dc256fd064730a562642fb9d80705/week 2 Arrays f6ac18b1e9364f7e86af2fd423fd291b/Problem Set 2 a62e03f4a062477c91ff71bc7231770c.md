# Problem Set 2

## **What to Do**

Did you start CS50x in 2021 or prior? Be sure to **[follow these instructions](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/new/#did-you-start-cs50x-in-2021-or-earlier)** if you haven’t already!

1. Log into [code.cs50.io](https://code.cs50.io/) using your GitHub account
2. Run `update50` in your codespace’s terminal window to ensure your codespace is up-to-date and, when prompted, click **Rebuild now**
3. Submit [Readability](../ProblemSets%204c4bcc2cf3cd425382614733495f6ba8/Readability%20187f16675b1140bcbcf17a481190c927.md)
4. Submit one of:
    - [Caesar,](../ProblemSets%204c4bcc2cf3cd425382614733495f6ba8/Caesar%206011b2ace3304ffd995fefb76a4aeca9.md) if feeling less comfortable
    - [Substitution](../ProblemSets%204c4bcc2cf3cd425382614733495f6ba8/Substitution%207959535933a24c71a09a816a05904180.md), if feeling more comfortable

If you submit both Caesar and Substitution, we’ll record the higher of your two scores.

## **When to Do It**

## **Advice**

- Try out any of David’s programs from class via [Week 2](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/weeks/2/)’s examples.
- To see the manual pages for C functions, visit [manual.cs50.io](https://manual.cs50.io/).
- If you see any errors when compiling your code with `make`, focus first on fixing the very first error you see, scrolling up as needed. If unsure what it means, try asking `help50` for help. For instance, if trying to compile `readability`, and
    
    ```
    make readability
    ```
    
    is yielding errors, try running
    
    ```
    help50 make readability
    ```
    
    instead!
